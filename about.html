	    at an affordable price point, Jakel Trading was built on a tradition of trust – with emphasis on both reliability and consistency.
            Building on its successes, Jakel Group has expanded into four new divisions of business which include Retail, Property 
	    (established – 2011), Oil & Gas, and Manufacturing.
	    With a strategic landbank throughout major cities in Malaysia, and a vision to be the country’s Preferred Property Developer,

            The story began in January 1983 when the late Mohamed Jakel Bin Ahmad started his small retail business in Muar, Johor. 
	    The company was carrying JAKEL TRADING as a trademark in the textile industry to win over their customers. 
	    Mohamed Jakel later had expanded the business to Segamat, where the empire labeled as a dominant player in the industry.
	    In 1992, JAKEL TRADING further expanded its operations by venturing as a textile semi-wholesaler and supplier for the government agencies 
	    and private sectors. JAKEL TRADING continued to be a highly developed and respected textile company between 1992 and 1997.

	      JAKEL TRADING marked the 30th anniversary in 2015. In conjunction to its milestone, an iconic mall is launched that is equipped with 
	      330,000 square feet, a world renowned, first single operator textile mall, globally known as the JAKEL MALL KUALA LUMPUR. 
	      It has become one of the most iconic buildings in Kuala Lumpur and thus, JAKEL TRADING’s status as the leader in the textile industry 
	      has been stabilized once again.
